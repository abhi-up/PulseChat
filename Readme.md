# PulseChat âœ¨

PulseChat is a real-time chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization, as well as Socket.io for real-time communication between clients and the server.

## Features

-   Real-time messaging: Instantly chat with other users in real-time.
-   User authentication: Securely authenticate users using JSON Web Tokens.
-   Responsive design: Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
-   User-friendly interface: Intuitive design for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store user data and chat messages.
-   **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the server-side application.
-   **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend of the application.
-   **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment used to execute server-side code.
-   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Token-based authentication mechanism used to verify the identity of users.
-   **Socket.io:** Library for real-time web applications, facilitating bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
